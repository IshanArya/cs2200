Problem 1B
----------

# of CPUs | Total Execution Time
     1            67.6
     2            36.0
     4            33.2

There is a linear relationship between number of CPUs and total execution time up to 2 CPUs.
The execution time is no longer linear at 4 CPUs because the VM only has 2 CPUs, so 4 threads
cannot truly run concurrently.

Problem 2B
----------

Timeslices | Total Time in READY state
   800                 325.4
   600                 312.9
   400                 298.8
   200                 285.2

In a real OS, if the timeslice is too small, the process won't have time to get any meaningful
work done before it has to give up the processor. Thus each process will appear to be running
extremely slowly.
