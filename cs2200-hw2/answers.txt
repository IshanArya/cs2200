Short Answer
----------

Instead of "goto LABEL", one could "lea" the LABEL into a temporary register
and then "jalr" to that register, setting the RA to something random.

Example:

goto    label       ! instead of this

lea     $t0, label  ! use this (assuming $t0 and $t1 is unused)
jalr    $t1, $t0
